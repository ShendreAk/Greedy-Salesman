            <h2>About Greedy Salesman</h2>
            <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">Greedy Salesman is a web app which uses time series forecasting model at the backend. The purpose of developing this app is to 
            forecast furniture sales for the next upcoming month based on the input timestamp. This model is based on the famous superstore sales dataset from tableau. The codes for this project can be checked in my <a href="https://github.com/ShendreAk" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">Github repo</a>.
