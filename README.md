# Greedy-Salesman
Greedy Salesman is a web app which uses time series forecasting model at the backend. The purpose of developing this app is to forecast furniture sales for the next upcoming month based on the input timestamp. This model is based on the famous superstore sales dataset from tableau. The model used in app are fbprophet and sarima. Although, in the notebook I have explored other available time series models. Check ou the notebook for more.
